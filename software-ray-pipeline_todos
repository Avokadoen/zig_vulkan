* [ ] share logic between pipelines for descriptors
* [ ] common data structure with ray buffer and different buffer regions
* [ ] integrate tracy!
* [ ] only use one submit call
    * [ ] replace semaphores with pipeline barrier
* [ ] static command buffers + handle of window rescale + changin rt settings (rerecord on demand)
* [ ] implement all steps/stages
    * [x] emit
    * [ ] traverse 
    * [ ] miss pipeline
    * [ ] scatter pipeline
    * [x] draw ray pipeline
* [ ] potentially use a single command buffer? (only record it in individual buffers)
* [x] only one atomicAdd pr warp, use shared memory to share start index with threads that use thread id + warp offset to grab rays
